                 <p class="lead"><span >Imagine… a world with a drone in every home.</p> 

                 <p><b>Drone Technology Simplified: From Purchase to Takeoff</b> is a comprehensive introductory course taking you behind the hype and fanfare of drones—an industry growing like wildfire—to teach you how to buy, build, and fly your very first DIY drone (multicopter).</p> 

                 <p>Ready to fly drones are great, however, if you want true performance and adaptability at a reasonable price, you’ll need to learn how to build your own aerial platform. But it can be hard when you’re first starting out to know which parts to buy and how to configure all of the components.</p> 

                 <p>Drone pilots are earning up to $15,000 a day flying for Hollywood production companies, large utility companies, and government agencies. But before you can tap that source of wealth, you need to fully understand <b>what makes a great craft and how it works.</b></p> 

                 <p>You’ll be led by Arland Whitfield, founder of SkyworksPro, LLC, a full-service drone company. He’ll walk you through the very same decisions and methods he used to build his first drone.</p> 

                 <p>Arland will be joined throughout the course by <b>expert videographers</b>, photographers, drone entrepreneurs, and lawyers to help you better appreciate and utilize your first drone.</p> 

                 <p>This course is intended for the drone apprentice who wants to take their knowledge from <b>0 to 100</b> in only a short period of time—6 hours in fact. The best students will be ready to buy a full-scale craft and to search for new opportunities.</p>
