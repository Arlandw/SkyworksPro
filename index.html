                <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">About the Course</h2>

                <p class="lead"><span>Imagine… a world with a drone in every home.</p> 

                 <p><b>Drone Technology Simplified: From Purchase to Takeoff</b> is a comprehensive introductory course taking you behind the hype and fanfare of drones—an industry growing like wildfire—to teach you how to buy, build, and fly your very first DIY drone (multicopter).</p> 

                 <p>Ready to fly drones are great, however, if you want true performance and adaptability at a reasonable price, you’ll need to learn how to build your own aerial platform. But it can be hard when you’re first starting out to know which parts to buy and how to configure all of the components.</p> 

                 <p>Drone pilots are earning up to $15,000 a day flying for Hollywood production companies, large utility companies, and government agencies. But before you can tap that source of wealth, you need to fully understand <b>what makes a great craft and how it works.</b></p> 

                 <p>You’ll be led by Arland Whitfield, founder of SkyworksPro, LLC, a full-service drone company. He’ll walk you through the very same decisions and methods he used to build his first drone.</p> 

                 <p>Arland will be joined throughout the course by <b>expert videographers</b>, photographers, drone entrepreneurs, and lawyers to help you better appreciate and utilize your first drone.</p> 

                 <p>This course is intended for the drone apprentice who wants to take their knowledge from <b>0 to 100</b> in only a short period of time—6 hours in fact. The best students will be ready to buy a full-scale craft and to search for new opportunities.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Course Objectives</h2>

                 <p>We want to make sure you have all of the information and necessary resources to get started in the drone industry today. Our goal is to provide you a comprehensive background in the theory, purchasing, building, and operations of your very own drone. We’ve broken the course out into five distinct phases which dynamically build upon each other.</p>


                <label for="panel_1">Phase I - Fundamentals of Flight</label>
                    <input type="radio" name="panel" id="panel_1">
                        <div class="collapsible">
                            <p>We won’t make you remember formulas and schematics, however, you will learn the basic science and operational theory behind multirotor flight. We believe this is a very important topic many drone courses fail to adequately, if at all, teach.</p>
                            <p>A solid theoretical foundation of drone components and flight mechanics will help you better understand every purchase decision made throughout the life of your drone.</p>

                        <div class="collapsible">
                          <p>It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of pages of motors, rotors, frames, and batteries you    could conceivably buy for your drone. We’ve been there—lost, confused, and needing help.</p>
                          <p>We’ll expose you to some of the most reputable manufacturers and distributors in this section. We’ve also hooked up some pretty sweet deals with our distribution partners to make your drone build more affordable.</p>

                            <p>This section will dive deep into the specific techniques and how-to steps for assembling your drone. You’ll learn important skills such as soldering, electrical wiring, and equipment mounting.</p>
                            <p>Your drone will come alive in front of your eyes. By the end of the section you’ll have a beautiful craft which you can show off to all of your friends.</p>
                            <p>Hardware isn’t the only thing we’ll teach you to build. We’ll help you program your radio and flight controllers so you can easily and confidently fly your craft in any situation.</p>

                            <p>We made the entire course just for this section. All of the hard work you put in before this point will pay off the moment you hear those motors startup and see your drone liftoff. It’ll be like saying hello to your new baby.</p>
                            <p>We want to make sure you’re fully prepared for a safe and fun maiden voyage with your drone. So we’ll cover everything from preflight checks to various flying techniques. We’ll also throw in some advanced tips and tricks we’ve picked up along the way—making the whole experience that much more enjoyable.</p>

                            <p>If only it were as easy as turning the thing on and hitting the go switch. Unfortunately though, you’re bound to run into various in-flight and ground control problems needing a quick fix.</p>
                            <p>You’ll get exposed to some of the more common problems in this section and learn how to efficiently troubleshoot them. While we can’t cover everything under the sun in our videos, we’ll do our best.</p>
                            <p>We’re also implementing a great synchronous method for you to get your problems solved. We’ve decided to give you the opportunity to ask your most pressing questions in a weekly Hangout session with Arland.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">FAQ</h2>

                <p>We’re sure you have some questions about the course and its logistics. Hopefully the below FAQ section will answer most of those concerns. However, if we missed anything or if something is really gnawing at you, let us know, and we’ll personally deliver you a handcrafted answer.</p>


                <label for="panel_7">Logistics</label>

                        <div class="collapsible">
                            <p><b>What’s the price of the course?</b></p>
                            <p>We don’t have a price yet, we’re waiting to hear from you before setting one. What would you pay for it?</p>
                            <p><b>I have some experience with flying drones, is this course still relevant to me?</b></p>
                            <p>As Benjamin Franklin says, ‘an investment in knowledge pays the best interest. Flying a drone is very different from designing and building the perfect craft. We think your piloting skills could likely be enhanced from the in-depth approach we take to drone education.</p>
                            <p><b>What if I sign up and realize this isn’t the right course for me?</b></p>
                            <p>We’ll give you your money back, no questions asked… except maybe a question or two about how we could build the perfect course for you. Just make sure you ask for the refund within 14 days of buying the course.</p>

                            <p><b>Do I need any special supplies or equipment for this course?</b></p>
                            <p>You can take the course for fun, but we think you’ll get much more out of it if you build along with us. For that to happen, you’ll need to buy the various drone components we outline throughout the course (frame, motors, rotors, flight controller, radio controller, etc). You’ll also need some basic assembly equipment like a soldering iron, screwdriver, and pliers. But don’t worry, we go over all of this stuff in detail at the beginning of the course.</p>
                            <p><b>Where should I buy materials if I don’t already have them?</b></p>
                            <p>We’ve lined up a sweet deal for you with our friends at Quadrocopter.com. We want to see you fly so badly that we’ve assembled an all inclusive kit that gives you everything you need for the build. You’re on your own for soldering irons and screwdrivers, but we’d be happy to recommend some options which have worked for us.</p>
                            <p><b>How can I trust the information presented in this course?</b></p>
                            <p>We’re not trying to be snake oil salesmen here. We’ve worked hard to ensure this course is engaging, timely, and ultimately relevant for your droning needs. The instructors are experts in the drone and education fields, with years of experience. Heck you can even interview us before buying the course if you want- we’re here to work with and for you.</p>

                            <p><b>I don’t have much free time, will this course take long?</b></p>
                            <p>The course itself is only slightly over 6 hours, its building the drone which might take you a little bit, especially if you need to practice your soldering skills. However, we believe the time is well worth it! Imagine the pride you’ll feel after your crafts’ maiden voyage. You can also watch the videos at any interval, no need to do it in one sitting.</p>
                            <p><b>Will I have to do any homework or assignments?</b></p>
                            <p>We’ve designed some very useful challenges and assignments which help you plan, purchase, and build your drone. These tasks are certainly not busy work (remember college?), they’re practical steps which make the building and flying process much easier.</p>
                            <p><b>What if I need or want some personal help on my drone build?</b></p>
                            <p>We’re here for you during every step of the process; on email, by phone, or over a Skype call. We’ve even decided to offer weekly Hangout sessions where you can get your questions answered and speak directly with us. Bring your best and most difficult drone questions to these sessions!</p>

                            <p>All material will be fully accessible through the Udemy online learning management system (fancy word for website). You’ll be able to easily access your material 24/7/365 from all over the world– well maybe not from North Korea.</p>
                            <p><b>How long will I have access to the videos, worksheets, and learning community?</b></p>
                            <p>For your entire life! How about that for a deal. Buy the course once and you’ll have unlimited access until you decide you’ve had enough.</p>
                            <p><b>What’s this online learning community you keep talking about?</b></p>
                            <p>Well, Udemy is awesome, and allows students to interact with each other through some great peer-to-peer teaching tools. All in all, you get out of this course what you put in, so if you’re spending the money, why not utilize all of its resources- instructor and student alike.</p>
